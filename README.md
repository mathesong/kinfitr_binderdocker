# kinfitr_binderdocker

This is the Dockerfile for the *kinfitr_binderdocker* docker container. This container contains all the R packages needed to perform kinetic modelling using the kinfitr R package, and some additional tools too for the kinfitr tutorial I have presented at Karolinska Institutet, to be opened within a binder.
